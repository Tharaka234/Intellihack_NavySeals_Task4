Stock Price Prediction Challenge
Overview
This project aims to predict the closing price of a stock 5 trading days into the future using historical stock price data. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. The final model is evaluated using both statistical metrics (RMSE) and simulated trading performance.

Deliverables
Jupyter Notebook: Contains the complete code for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

EDA Report: Includes visualizations, insights, and feature engineering decisions.

Model Documentation: Explains the model selection process, evaluation metrics, and limitations.

CSV File: Contains the predictions for the test period.

README File: Summarizes the approach, key findings, and instructions to reproduce the results.

Instructions to Reproduce Results
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
2. Download the Dataset
Download the dataset (stock_data.csv) and place it in the data/ folder.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook (stock_price_prediction.ipynb) in the notebooks/ folder and execute the cells in order. The notebook contains the complete workflow, including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Development

Model Evaluation

Simulated Trading Performance

4. View the Reports

Model Documentation: Also located in the reports/ folder, this document explains the model selection process, evaluation metrics, and limitations.

5. Check the Predictions
The predictions for the test period are saved in the outputs/ folder as predictions.csv.

Key Findings
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset contains no missing values.

The closing price shows a clear upward trend over time, with some seasonal fluctuations.

Lag features and moving averages were created to capture historical trends.

2. Model Development
The XGBoost Regressor was chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and its performance on time series data.

The model was trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%.

3. Model Evaluation
RMSE: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) measures the average deviation of the predicted closing price from the actual closing price.

Directional Accuracy: The model's ability to correctly predict the direction of the price movement (up or down) was evaluated.

Simulated Trading Performance: A simulated trading strategy was implemented to evaluate the practical trading value of the model.

4. Limitations
The model's performance is highly dependent on the quality and completeness of the historical data.

Sudden market changes (e.g., news events) may not be captured by the model.

Future work can focus on incorporating external data and experimenting with more advanced models.

Conclusion
The project successfully predicts the stock's closing price 5 trading days into the future with reasonable accuracy. The simulated trading strategy demonstrates the practical value of the model. However, there are limitations, and future work can focus on improving the model's robustness and incorporating additional features.
